Power Components Demo Theme
==========

This theme is fork from [octoberrain/demo-theme
](https://github.com/octoberrain/demo-theme). It was created to test and show features of [Power Components plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/initbiz-powercomponents).

> Read the docs of Power Components here: [pc.init.biz](http://pc.init.biz/).

It uses the fork of [October Rain's](https://github.com/octoberrain) [Test plugin](https://github.com/octoberrain/test-plugin) that can be found here: [github.com/initbizlab/pc-test-plugin](https://github.com/initbizlab/pc-test-plugin)

As a consequence those two themes differs in:

* navigation (added Power Components pages)
* including Power Components assets in head and footer
* pages with components using Power Components

**The theme won't work if you do not have [Power Components Test Plugin](https://github.com/initbizlab/pc-test-plugin) and [Power Components](https://octobercms.com/plugin/initbiz-powercomponents) installed.
**

This theme was (and will be) used in videos presenting Power Components functionality.
